        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          The European hamster has brown dorsal fur with white patches. The
          chest and belly are black. The tail is short and furred. It is much
          larger than the Syrian (Mesocricetus auratus) or dwarf hamsters
          (Phodopus sp.), which are commonly kept as pets, and is the largest
          known species of hamster. It weighs 220–460 g (7.8–16.2 oz) and can
          grow to 20–35 cm (8–14 in) long with a tail of 4–6 cm (1.6–2.4 in).
          Its dental formula is 1.0.0.3 1.0.0.3 . In captivity, the European
          hamster has an unusually long lifespan for a rodent, living up to
          eight years.

        <h3>Behaviour</h3>
        <p>
          The common hamster is a nocturnal or crepuscular species. It lives in
          a complex burrow system. It eats seeds, legumes, root vegetables,
          grasses and insects. It transports its food in its elastic cheek
          pouches to the food storage chambers. The storage chambers may be
          quite large and on average contain 2–3 kg (4.4–6.6 lb) of food, but
          exceptionally can be up to 65 kg (143 lb). It hibernates between
          October and March. During this time, it wakes every five to seven days
          to feed from the storage chambers. They are usually solitary animals.

        <h3>Breeding</h3>
        <p>
          The adults reach sexual maturity when they are about 43 days old and
          breed from early April to August. The gestation period is 18–20 days
          and the size of the litter ranges from three to 15 young, which are
          weaned when aged three weeks.
